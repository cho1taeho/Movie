While not perfect, the apartheid analogy is a useful framework by which to educate people on the complex issues facing Israelis and Palestinians.",

African-Americans, for the first time in history, have turned the tide and altered the direction of US foreign policy. The US, once the backbone of support for the apartheid regime as her ally in the Cold War, finally imposes sanctions on Pretoria.

The film paints a harrowing picture of forced conscription in the 1970s and 1980s and brings to light a hidden history of persecution, which was an integral aspect of the brutality of apartheid.",

The Great Leap Forward conceived by Mao so that China could drive industrial output ahead of Great Britain and achieve autonomy from the might of the neighbouring USSR  led to a catastrophic famine resulting in the death of between 36 and 55 million people.\n\nBut the tragedy was masked by an official lie, because while China was starving to death, the grain stores were full.\n\nBased on previously unheard testimony by survivors, rare archive footage, secret documents and interviews with the leading historians on this catastrophe, this film provides, for the first time, an insight into the folly of the Great Leap Forward. It examines the mechanisms and political decisions that led to famine, stripping away the incredible secrecy surrounding the campaign, and exposing the lie which continues even today as to who was responsible, and the true human cost",

Today the Irish famine is recognised as the worst humanitarian disaster of the 19th Century but what is less recognised is that the crisis impacted far beyond Ireland’s shores. The story of the Blight pathogen that killed the potato crop, starts in the Andes of South America and then reaches into the heart of northern Europe where the collapse of potato crops causes the deaths of 100,000 people adding further fuel to social tensions that lead to Europe’s year of revolutions in 1848.",

It was repeated in the UK on Dave in 2008. The Fishing with the Corleones sequence involving the late Anita Roddick was omitted from the repeat.\n\nThe show was set in the lochs of Scotland, on which Hall and Wilmot would go fishing. However, very few fish were caught, and the situation instead formed the setting for dialogue between the pair which would be vaguely themed on subjects like love or the Olympic Games. Some episodes featured sketches involving characters such as Bob, a decapitated limousine driver whose head had survived, and Charles Manson, a reclusive salesman who, despite his appearance, was not the convicted serial killer of the same name. Each episode would end with a celebrity guest who was invited on to the boat to talk and fish with the pair.\n\nAt the end of each show, a celebrity guest would appear and talk with Hall and Wilmot. The idea was seen earlier in a pilot the pair had called Rich Hall's Badly Funded Think Tank. In that show, the segment was titled \"Fishing with the Corleones\", but in the Fishing Show these sections are unappended.",
