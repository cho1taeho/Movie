The\nmission briefly, is to construct the conditions in which citizens of plural\nbackgrounds and perspectives can come together and deliberate on\nhow they can work to benefit and empower the least advantaged in\nsociety.",

Farmers in these areas mostly rely on traditional methods of farming, resulting in low agricultural production and hence, income. Lack of knowledge and poor irrigation facilities elevate their problems. Due to problems as such, migration towards cities in search of better livelihood is being pursued extensively. Further, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown its effects on poor farmers leaving fewer opportunities of income.",
        "longTermImpact": "Trainings on advanced farming practices &market linkages, extensive agricultural support, improved irrigation will expand the horizon of understanding of small farmers. This will enable them to adopt various methods and practices to increase productivity, income and also, meet the family's food and nutritional requirements. The farmers will gain access to a long-term livelihood solution, they can secure their food needs, manage their resources & will not have to migrate to cities.",
        "activities": "Given the background, the project aims at not only improving the livelihood of small farmers but also at improving their food and nutritional intake. The intervention will build capacities of farmers in advanced farming techniques and will also increase availability of water for irrigation. With more water available, farmers can now grow more than one crop in a year which will lead to enhancement of their income. Better well-being and higher income will help them sustain and come out of poverty.",

With climate changes wrecking havoc throughout Africa, - raining too much in some places and not raising at all in others - crops are failing and more people that ever are going hungry.  When children go hungry, they start missing school as they are too weak to walk the long distances.  They also can't take their medicine, as their bellies hurt when food isn't cushioning the medicine.",

Food sustainability allows the families to eat well, which means that they will take medicine regularly.

The pay-it-forward component in the program guarantees other families will benefit, too.",

Since its inception, Self-Help has served as a vessel; training, education, and opportunities are provided to rural citizens and whole communities in developing countries so that they can have better lives. \n\nMISSION STATEMENT: To alleviate hunger by helping people help themselves. \n\nSELF-HELP'S INITIATIVE\nEducate: We educate the people of the United States to understand the problems of life in developing countries particularly the awareness of the perpetual struggle by millions to produce and distribute food to battle persistent chronic hunger and poverty; we help tell their story\n\nTrain: We train people in developing countries in the use of Quality Protein Maize (QPM). This increases crop yields and improves nutrition. We assist local farm families with planting, \n\nImprove: We improve infant and pre-school children's diets by administering an improved porridge feeding program. Made from QPM and pinches of barley malt, this combination has been proven to alleviate malnutrition, thwart sickness, and keep children in school so they can continue their education.\n\nEmpower: We provide micro-credit loans for women to start small scale businesses. This availability of credit empowers women and increases their income - because they do not have access to traditional financing.\n\nCooperate: We cooperate with other organizations and agencies in the introduction of appropriate farming practices or advancement in the battle against poverty and malnutrition.",

        "need": "In Ghana, 28% of children under the age of five are stunted due to chronic malnutrition. For children 2 years old and younger, proper nutrition is crucial for foundational brain and physical development. For school-aged children, chronic hunger can be devastating to learning, yet many children arrive to school on empty stomachs. Protein is critical to children's diets to allow for effective brain development, yet few children have access to the protein they need on a daily basis.",
        "longTermImpact": "Our School Feeding Programs supports 600 students enrolled in preschool, kindergarten & 1st grade in rural schools around the Ashanti region. Introducing the program doubles school enrollment, increases daily attendance, and decreases absenteeism. Children are better able to learn and focus on their studies. GHFGHC serves 180 women & their infants, decreasing incidence of stunting. Infants are developing healthier brains and bodies so they can achieve their full potential throughout their lives.",
        "activities": "The GHFGHC program teaches expectant and new mothers about nutritious weaning foods, shows mothers how to produce nutritious foods, and provides nutrition interventions for infants to ensure they get the best start. The School Feeding Program provides children with a nutritious daily porridge so they can be well fed and ready to learn. Parent-Teacher Association members grow and provide the Quality Protein Maize (QPM) for the porridge, fostering community ownership and long-term sustainability.",
