The protection and enhancement of the natural environment.\n2. The conservation of rainforests and the preservation of the biodiversity of rainforest ecosystems.\n3. The restoration, rehabilitation, enhancement and management of remnant and regrowth rainforest.\n4. The revegetation of ex-rainforest lands, including without limitation the establishment and ongoing management of rainforests plantings or signficant ecological value.\n\nThe strategies that we employ to achieve these objectives is to:\n1. Seek funding in the form of donation and sponsorships from individuals, businesses and philanthropic trusts and foundations.\n2. Purchase and protect high conservation value rainforest and preserve its biodiveristy; and\n3. Finance projects that re-establish rainforests through planting, maintenance and restoration programs.\n\nRainforest Rescue meaures its performance of these objectives and strategies through ongoing governance, financial management and corporate compliance, therefore achieving the environmental objectives of the organisation's constitution being the protection and preservation of rainforests.\n\nRainforest Rescue is an Australian registered company limited by guarantee and a registered charity with deductible gift recipient status.

In 2007, CEMINA shifted its focus from radio to the capacity building for social start ups and education for adaptation to climate change. One of its main projects was Adapta Sertao, which  developed a social technology that benefits the population of small underserved towns in the semi-arid region of Brazil, articulating a group of social technologies that use scare resources such as water and arable land to guarantee the livelihoods of the local farming communities. The project received very prestigious awards such as the 2008 SEED Award. It has also been recognized as a best practice by UN Habitat.   In 2008, CEMINA developed a second agroecological program to restore de Atlantic Rainforest in the peripheral communities of Rio de Janeiro,  called Sinal do Vale. Since then, SINAL has grown to take prominence as a reference of sustainability solutions and environmental education in the region, hosting more than 4,000 change agents from all over the world and acting as a hub where innovative ideas are tested and scaled up.",

Seek funding in the form of donation and sponsorships from individuals, businesses and philanthropic trusts and foundations.\n2. Purchase and protect high conservation value rainforest and preserve its biodiveristy; and\n3.

            "mission": "At Reef Life Foundation, our mission is to revitalize threatened ecosystems through holistic, scientific solutions, racing against climate change to restore and protect the valuable reef ecosystems we have left. We fund the research, design, and construction of IntelliReefs: nanotechnology marine restoration structures that mimic the complex, mineral composition of natural ecosystems. \n\nIntelliReefs are made from unique mineral mixtures that allow artificial reefs to be fine-tuned and customized down to the nanoscale to support site, species, and function specific conservation goals. IntelliReefs have been shown to increase fish aggregation, biodiversity, the speed of animal settlement, and attract wild coral spawn. We are currently the only company on the market that can cast large-scale structures from tens of metres to kilometres long. \n\nOur goal is to build over a million square feet of enhanced nanotechnology reefs by 2025, restoring dying coral ecosystems back to diverse and sustainable habitats. We work above the water line with local businesses and NGOs to create jobs, food security, and environmental resilience to climate change. We aim to foster the next generation of coral reef guardians and increase environmental justice for local communities by providing online coral reef educational curricula.\n\nReef Life Foundation is part of a global network of environmental and non-profit organizations dedicated to addressing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). We collaborate with the UN on SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality & Women's Empowerment) through our coral reef restoration initiatives and educational outreach with island and developing nations.",

Large scale coral reef destruction not only harms marine life, but severely destroys local business and island communities that rely on healthy oceans to survive.",

Because IntelliReefs can be scaled up to any size and shape, eco-tourist businesses recognize it's potential to cultivate economic AND biological growth.  Long-term goals include building square kilometers of IntelliReefs world-wide, encouraging ocean conservation through collaborative research, and community education opportunities.",
