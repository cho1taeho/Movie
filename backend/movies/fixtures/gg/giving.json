Sustainable techniques like drip irrigation and multi-cropping require less work, while the biodiversity of non-GMO seeds extends the harvest over a longer period.

Improved education combined with a knowledge of sustainable farming will help a new generation create thriving agribusinesses.",

            "mission": "The reality for many underprivileged people in Pattaya, is a life that is entrapped by poverty and abuse. Their lives are marked by a lack of adequate care, food, shelter and an uncertainty about the future. Many of these people earn a meager living as street vendors, garbage collectors, prostitutes or beggars. Drug & alcohol abuse is common in these communities, making them very dangerous places for children to grow up in.\n\nThose living in the slums are also at constant risk of abuse and exploitation, and a way to break out of this cycle of poverty seems almost impossible. Slum dwellers are often without the benefits of a house registration, which is needed to access healthcare, education and other government support services. In addition, without a birth certificate a child faces an entire lifetime of living as an 'alien' in their own home country.\n\nHand to Hand is a Christian organization that is based in Pattaya, who recognise that human rights apply to all age groups. We seek to protect those who are marginalised regardless of their race, age or religion. We achieve this by showing them the love of Jesus Christ through prayer and, on a much more practical level, by providing services such as helping them acquire legal documentation and offering food, clothing and educating the poor.",

Two outstanding individuals from each village will train and provide continual support/coaching, so that hunger and malnutrition are decreased and resolved. Parents will support their children to go to school and learn to farm by helping their parents.  The practice of agroecology will help to build on ancestral knowledge and nurture a healthy land.",
        "activities": "We will educate and provide resources for 1,000 families and children in 10 villages about agricultural practices, farming, and animal husbandry. Kitchen gardens will support people with an opportunity for a balanced diet and an increased food supply. The produce from the trees will provide an income for the family. The Saturday program will educate children through stories, nutrition training and a meal provided. Working together is the main focus of the program and organization.",

These graints have grown over mellenia and are entirely adapted to the dry mountain ecosystem. Providing some 40 local farmers who practise livelihood farming with these varieties will decrease their expenses, their dependency on external sources and provide them and families with bread, major food staple in the region.",

        "need": "Anti-Atlas farmers practicing livelihood agriculture  find it increasingly challenging to reproduce their planting ways and seasons as they, and their ancestors, have done because of the grains used. Today wheat, barely and millet grains for planting are bought every year, further driving already vulnerable farmers into poverty and lowering the harvest yield given these grains need generations of planting to adapt to the dry local ecosystem.",
        "longTermImpact": "The project will give the opportunity to farmers to plant grains that have adapted to this ecosystem, and will provide them and their families with hearty and healthy grains to make bread, the major food staple in this region of Morocco.  Once the individual farming is fully mastered and integrated after some 4 planting seasons, we plan on creating a sustainble cooperative model to further markett these grains to secure fund-generating activities and autonomy for these vulnerable communities.",
        "activities": "Dar Si Hmad operates a didactic farm in the heart of the Anti-Atlas Mountains and through this project we will collect, store, label, plant, grow and tend to the original, endemic species of the grains to this region. We will distribute grain-packages to the participating farmers of the didactic farm and we will do continous monitoring and evaluation. Having access to this source of grains free of charge will solve the problem of purchasing grains for farmers already suffering from poverty",

Since its inception, Self-Help has served as a vessel; training, education, and opportunities are provided to rural citizens and whole communities in developing countries so that they can have better lives. \n\nMISSION STATEMENT: To alleviate hunger by helping people help themselves. \n\nSELF-HELP'S INITIATIVE\nEducate: We educate the people of the United States to understand the problems of life in developing countries particularly the awareness of the perpetual struggle by millions to produce and distribute food to battle persistent chronic hunger and poverty; we help tell their story\n\nTrain: We train people in developing countries in the use of Quality Protein Maize (QPM). This increases crop yields and improves nutrition. We assist local farm families with planting, \n\nImprove: We improve infant and pre-school children's diets by administering an improved porridge feeding program. Made from QPM and pinches of barley malt, this combination has been proven to alleviate malnutrition, thwart sickness, and keep children in school so they can continue their education.\n\nEmpower: We provide micro-credit loans for women to start small scale businesses. This availability of credit empowers women and increases their income - because they do not have access to traditional financing.\n\nCooperate: We cooperate with other organizations and agencies in the introduction of appropriate farming practices or advancement in the battle against poverty and malnutrition.",

Introducing the program doubles school enrollment, increases daily attendance, and decreases absenteeism. Children are better able to learn and focus on their studies. GHFGHC serves 180 women & their infants, decreasing incidence of stunting. Infants are developing healthier brains and bodies so they can achieve their full potential throughout their lives.",

        "need": "Cheetah are often blamed-and killed-for livestock loss in Namibia.  CCF breeds a large, aggressive breed of dog used for centuries in Turkey to guard livestock, and distributes puppies at no cost to subsistence livestock farmers in Namibia.  The dogs bond tightly with their charges, and alert their herds when a predator approaches. In most cases, the dog's bark is enough to deter most predators.  Not only do the farmers benefit by losing fewer animals, fewer cheetahs are killed.",
        "longTermImpact": "Conflict with humans-specifically livestock farmers-is one of the biggest threats to the cheetah.  Namibian livestock herds with guard dogs experience a decrease in predation of 80 to 100%. This will save the lives of hundreds of cheetahs a year.",
        "activities": "Each year, CCF breeds and places about 30 puppies with subsistence livestock farmers, who are required to attend a course on how to care for the dogs.  CCF follows up annually with owners of dogs to ensure they are being cared for properly.",

        "activities": "Abriendo Oportunidades is part of a generation of programs anchored in communities that face social and economic exclusion. The program organizes girls in groups and brings them together in safe spaces to build their life skills and offer them mentoring. The program invests in educational resources for girls, stipends for mentors and, since 2018, in seed funding for mentors to develop productive projects.",

        "need": "An increase in bias incidents and hate crimes, in particular related to youth, has created a volatile environment in Montgomery County schools and communities. Children and adults alike live in fear of sharing their own stories and struggle to advocate for themselves and those they care about. Language, cultural and economic barriers can create a sensation of distance and separation. The arts break down these barriers, honoring our uniqueness while connecting us, highlighting our commonalities.",
        "longTermImpact": "Workshops create a non-judgmental space in which participants are comfortable to share their experiences, perspectives and feelings. The facilitator and teaching artist give children and adults tools to appropriately handle conflicts, advocate for their needs and become more compassionate listeners. Art breaks down barriers and creates safe spaces to express emotions in ways that other strategies do not. Art becomes a part of the solution to the social-emotional problems communities are facing.",
        "activities": "Free workshops are offered in accessible public spaces in communities facing high rates of bias incidents and in spaces with existing programs addressing social justice issues - leveraging their existing audience and augmenting their programs. Workshop participants work with artists in multiple art forms to share their stories and hone their ability to share them with an audience. They then have opportunities to perform in free public performances alongside professionals, amplifying their story.",

            "mission": "We provide services and resources to the formerly incarcerated and criminal justice involved that lead to self sufficiency. I started Freedom Fighting Missionaries because I didn't want those returning from jails and prisons to face the struggles that I did. I served a 10 year federal sentence and was released in 2012 . I  struggled to find a job because of my background and even though I went to over a dozen non profits I was still refused a job 40 times in a row before finally being hired by Goodwill making $7.25 per hour with 5 children to take care of. I continued to press forward until I was given an opportunity in automotive industry as a car salesman at a Mazda store and I quickly grew to top sales man and over the course of 7 years I was promoted to finance manager and then sales manager. I was able to take care of my now 6 children. I continued to support those like myself along the way and in January I decided to launch my own non profit. I was given a great opportunity to work with a non profit in Charlotte and they were gracious enough to teach what I needed to know to go on my own. I had a plan and then Covid-19 followed by the murder of George Floyd. My workload increased by 90% and with limited resources I was forced to spring into action and start operating 24/7 and expanding our services to assist the elderly , homeless and those with criminal backgrounds coupled with a disability.\nWe focus our efforts on supporting those who have been incarcerated in jails and prisons by connecting them with services and resources that are specific to them. Our team of professionals all have lived experience and have successfully transitioned from prison to self sufficiency. Our unique approach is driven by our desire to see barriers broken down. The journey to self sufficiency from poverty is difficult in any city but it is especially difficult for those who have a criminal background and in many cases a documented disability. Our most vulnerable populations are in need of advocates as they try to navigate through technological changes . Through our experience working with and assisting those who have been in prison, chronically houseless, live below the poverty line and the elderly we have discovered that they need assistance filling out online forms, someone to speak on their behalf and lessons with using the internet or a cell phone. We encourage our community to support us by using the skills, time and resources they have to help those returning from prisons which in turn provides community safety as well as relief to taxes as our peers and their children are no longer dependent upon the government for assistance. We have developed a system that allows us as a community to assist men and women who have struggled with housing due to having a criminal background obtain housing. Finding suitable housing with a background is difficult but with community support it has proven to be possible. Our mission is to help make the best out of a secong chance.\nFreedom Fighting Missionaries Inc has recently partnered with Home Again Foundation to bring affordable housing solutions to vulnerable populations experiencing homelessness. I was working with another non profit Crisis Assistance trying to secure housing for one of my clients and I was  referred to Home Again Foundations Vickie Craighead-Davis and once I learned that they would accept those with a background I immediately put my full support behind them and we formed a partnership. They allowed two of my clients who I had been struggling to get housing into their housing program. We are currently working together to obtain funding to build 300 affordable units in the next 2-3 years. We currently have the support of Our County , City and local churches, with the support of Global Giving we can help change some lives.",

        "need": "In India and Nepal, children aged 4 to 14 are kidnapped or sold into slavery and forced to work up to 18 hours a day, weaving rugs for North American markets. They earn little or no money. They suffer malnutrition, wounds from using sharp tools, respiratory diseases from breathing wool fibers, and deformities from sitting long hours, some chained to their loom. Away from home, they don't get to enjoy childhood and can't go to school.",
        "longTermImpact": "GoodWeave believes that if enough people decide to buy one rug over another because it was made without child labor, then retailers and importers will demand only child-labor-free rugs from their manufacturers. The exciting news is it's working already! In just over a decade since GoodWeave started, the number of \"carpet kids\" has dropped dramatically - from 1 million to 250,000. With your help and with this project, the number can reach zero.",
        "activities": "GoodWeave rescues these exploited child weavers. We rehabilitate them, giving them the care they need to recover physically and emotionally. The children are reunited with their families if possible and offered an education. GoodWeave is also stopping the cycle of child labor and poverty, so fewer kids are trafficked or enslaved. We do this by educating consumers in North America, working with importers to monitor their weaving factories, and certifying carpets made by adult artisans.",
