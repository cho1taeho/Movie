Sustainable techniques like drip irrigation and multi-cropping require less work, while the biodiversity of non-GMO seeds extends the harvest over a longer period.

Improved education combined with a knowledge of sustainable farming will help a new generation create thriving agribusinesses.",

Now we have added classes for younger children, to inspire the next generation to preserve the family farm with sustainable agriculture when they grow up.",

            "mission": "The reality for many underprivileged people in Pattaya, is a life that is entrapped by poverty and abuse. Their lives are marked by a lack of adequate care, food, shelter and an uncertainty about the future. Many of these people earn a meager living as street vendors, garbage collectors, prostitutes or beggars. Drug & alcohol abuse is common in these communities, making them very dangerous places for children to grow up in.\n\nThose living in the slums are also at constant risk of abuse and exploitation, and a way to break out of this cycle of poverty seems almost impossible. Slum dwellers are often without the benefits of a house registration, which is needed to access healthcare, education and other government support services. In addition, without a birth certificate a child faces an entire lifetime of living as an 'alien' in their own home country.\n\nHand to Hand is a Christian organization that is based in Pattaya, who recognise that human rights apply to all age groups. We seek to protect those who are marginalised regardless of their race, age or religion. We achieve this by showing them the love of Jesus Christ through prayer and, on a much more practical level, by providing services such as helping them acquire legal documentation and offering food, clothing and educating the poor.",

        "activities": "The aim of the project is to train 12 key growers how to grow vegetables and herbs that are used commonly in Thai cooking so that they cannot only feed their families but also sell produce at the local market giving them not only financial independence but also a renewed hope for the future.

Poverty is extreme and the people have little to no means to provide for their daily needs. Within Nyanza the poverty rate is reported as 17.6%, but reality shows that the poverty is much higher in the villages.",

Two outstanding individuals from each village will train and provide continual support/coaching, so that hunger and malnutrition are decreased and resolved. Parents will support their children to go to school and learn to farm by helping their parents.  The practice of agroecology will help to build on ancestral knowledge and nurture a healthy land.",
        "activities": "We will educate and provide resources for 1,000 families and children in 10 villages about agricultural practices, farming, and animal husbandry. Kitchen gardens will support people with an opportunity for a balanced diet and an increased food supply. The produce from the trees will provide an income for the family. The Saturday program will educate children through stories, nutrition training and a meal provided. Working together is the main focus of the program and organization.",

        "summary": "This project will gather, grow, reproduce, store & distribute indigenous Amazigh Anti-Atlas variety of barely, millet and wheat seeds increasingly under threat of disappearing. These graints have grown over mellenia and are entirely adapted to the dry mountain ecosystem. Providing some 40 local farmers who practise livelihood farming with these varieties will decrease their expenses, their dependency on external sources and provide them and families with bread, major food staple in the region.",

        "need": "Anti-Atlas farmers practicing livelihood agriculture  find it increasingly challenging to reproduce their planting ways and seasons as they, and their ancestors, have done because of the grains used. Today wheat, barely and millet grains for planting are bought every year, further driving already vulnerable farmers into poverty and lowering the harvest yield given these grains need generations of planting to adapt to the dry local ecosystem.",
        "longTermImpact": "The project will give the opportunity to farmers to plant grains that have adapted to this ecosystem, and will provide them and their families with hearty and healthy grains to make bread, the major food staple in this region of Morocco.  Once the individual farming is fully mastered and integrated after some 4 planting seasons, we plan on creating a sustainble cooperative model to further markett these grains to secure fund-generating activities and autonomy for these vulnerable communities.",
        "activities": "Dar Si Hmad operates a didactic farm in the heart of the Anti-Atlas Mountains and through this project we will collect, store, label, plant, grow and tend to the original, endemic species of the grains to this region. We will distribute grain-packages to the participating farmers of the didactic farm and we will do continous monitoring and evaluation. Having access to this source of grains free of charge will solve the problem of purchasing grains for farmers already suffering from poverty",

In context of Nepal most of furtile land is in the Terai region that is why it is also known as bread basket of Nepal.
