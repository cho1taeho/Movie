        "need": "An increase in bias incidents and hate crimes, in particular related to youth, has created a volatile environment in Montgomery County schools and communities. Children and adults alike live in fear of sharing their own stories and struggle to advocate for themselves and those they care about. Language, cultural and economic barriers can create a sensation of distance and separation. The arts break down these barriers, honoring our uniqueness while connecting us, highlighting our commonalities.",
        "longTermImpact": "Workshops create a non-judgmental space in which participants are comfortable to share their experiences, perspectives and feelings. The facilitator and teaching artist give children and adults tools to appropriately handle conflicts, advocate for their needs and become more compassionate listeners. Art breaks down barriers and creates safe spaces to express emotions in ways that other strategies do not. Art becomes a part of the solution to the social-emotional problems communities are facing.",
        "activities": "Free workshops are offered in accessible public spaces in communities facing high rates of bias incidents and in spaces with existing programs addressing social justice issues - leveraging their existing audience and augmenting their programs. Workshop participants work with artists in multiple art forms to share their stories and hone their ability to share them with an audience. They then have opportunities to perform in free public performances alongside professionals, amplifying their story.",

Our programs have supported thousands of girls of color ages 6 - 18 from under-resourced communities in New York City to reach their fullest potentials. Our mission is to help girls transform their lives and grow in confidence, leadership, and academic achievement.  Our vision is for every student, regardless of socio-economic background, to develop the foundational academic, social and leadership skills to achieve her dreams. She will be a powerful speaker, an effective leader, live a healthy lifestyle and be a global citizen.  In 2017, we launched our first chapter in Detroit, bringing effective programming to a whole new community and expanding our impact.",

            "mission": "We provide services and resources to the formerly incarcerated and criminal justice involved that lead to self sufficiency. I started Freedom Fighting Missionaries because I didn't want those returning from jails and prisons to face the struggles that I did. I served a 10 year federal sentence and was released in 2012 . I  struggled to find a job because of my background and even though I went to over a dozen non profits I was still refused a job 40 times in a row before finally being hired by Goodwill making $7.25 per hour with 5 children to take care of. I continued to press forward until I was given an opportunity in automotive industry as a car salesman at a Mazda store and I quickly grew to top sales man and over the course of 7 years I was promoted to finance manager and then sales manager. I was able to take care of my now 6 children. I continued to support those like myself along the way and in January I decided to launch my own non profit. I was given a great opportunity to work with a non profit in Charlotte and they were gracious enough to teach what I needed to know to go on my own. I had a plan and then Covid-19 followed by the murder of George Floyd. My workload increased by 90% and with limited resources I was forced to spring into action and start operating 24/7 and expanding our services to assist the elderly , homeless and those with criminal backgrounds coupled with a disability.\nWe focus our efforts on supporting those who have been incarcerated in jails and prisons by connecting them with services and resources that are specific to them. Our team of professionals all have lived experience and have successfully transitioned from prison to self sufficiency. Our unique approach is driven by our desire to see barriers broken down. The journey to self sufficiency from poverty is difficult in any city but it is especially difficult for those who have a criminal background and in many cases a documented disability. Our most vulnerable populations are in need of advocates as they try to navigate through technological changes . Through our experience working with and assisting those who have been in prison, chronically houseless, live below the poverty line and the elderly we have discovered that they need assistance filling out online forms, someone to speak on their behalf and lessons with using the internet or a cell phone. We encourage our community to support us by using the skills, time and resources they have to help those returning from prisons which in turn provides community safety as well as relief to taxes as our peers and their children are no longer dependent upon the government for assistance. We have developed a system that allows us as a community to assist men and women who have struggled with housing due to having a criminal background obtain housing. Finding suitable housing with a background is difficult but with community support it has proven to be possible. Our mission is to help make the best out of a secong chance.\nFreedom Fighting Missionaries Inc has recently partnered with Home Again Foundation to bring affordable housing solutions to vulnerable populations experiencing homelessness. I was working with another non profit Crisis Assistance trying to secure housing for one of my clients and I was  referred to Home Again Foundations Vickie Craighead-Davis and once I learned that they would accept those with a background I immediately put my full support behind them and we formed a partnership. They allowed two of my clients who I had been struggling to get housing into their housing program. We are currently working together to obtain funding to build 300 affordable units in the next 2-3 years. We currently have the support of Our County , City and local churches, with the support of Global Giving we can help change some lives.",

Critical thinking skills are essential to academic success and also influence how students navigate their daily activities. A foundation of cultural awareness for people of African ancestry is built upon accurate interpretations of African history and culture, which will positively impact students' self-image and behavior, and strengthen their connection to Africa.",

These are innate, essential, and universal needs. Unfortunately, these needs go unmet in the American educational experience for children of color, particularly African ancestry. With our children's wellbeing compromised, their ability to learn is hindered, and willingness to engage limited.",
        "longTermImpact": "Completion of Shoolay programs increases likelihood of completing primary education and raises aspirations to enroll in college. Increased rates of graduation lead to more productive members of society.",
        "activities": "To counter these debilitating factors, Shoolay reshapes the public educational experience by facilitating guided discussions on African and race history, which enriches the general curriculum and strengthens students' academic performance. Increased interest, improved grades, and confidence are among the equity metrics used to gauge our programs' impact.",
